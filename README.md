# ClassRecorder
Utilizing OBS to record classes on a set schedule while you are away.

This was developed using Visual Studio 2019.

You will need to install OBS! Change the directories in the source code
to the install path you have OBS. Remember to use double //, as python will slice
your path as a string without them.

edit your OBS hotkeys for start/stop recording, or else this won't make sense.
go to settings in the bottom right corner -> Hotkeys to setup.

PYTHON LIBRARIES YOU WILL NEED TO INSTALL:

-pip

-pip install pywin32

-pip install schedule

This is just a layout/guide for setup. This won't be perfect unless
you put in the time to cater to your needs. This still needs some
work until semester return in september (for me at least).
